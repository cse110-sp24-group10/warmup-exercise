# Planning 

This documentation shall highlight the planning that went behind ensuring a successful creation of our example project. 
In this project we shall be trying to make an app which asks our user how they feel and, if they feel negative, we would
ask them to emphasize reasons. We shall be dividing this md into three parts: meeting notes, user stories, and a sample 
plan of our website.

## Meeting notes

**Meeting Date/Start Time**: 04/23/2024, 3:00pm
**Meeting End Time: Meeting Purpose**: Talking about warm-up
**Meeting Location**: Library 

We had three choices to pick from when deciding the warmup project we wanted to do. First option was sentiment widget website, 
whereas the other two were calendar planning website and a to-do list website. As a team, we finally decided to do our project 
based on creating a sentiment widget website. 

When creating the plan to make this website, we had to consider many things such as design element of the website and the coding
aspect. However, the most important thing we had to consider was user stories since we agreed that to ensure maximal utility of
our product we had to base our design on what the users want, which is why we have a section called user stories. We also had a
few ideas, as developers, in ensuring the maximization of usefulness of this website. Below contains some points brought up 
during discussion(not exhaustive by any means):

- Want to have 10 options to select
- **Hover over to enlarge (maybe pop up)**
- **Highlight**
- Being able to tab through
- Not having submit butting
- Try to find a way to implementing reclicking
- Text context if you'd like
- Text box below appears after we click
- Having more choices instead of 5
- Be able to change the range
- Ten items to cluttered
- 5 items good
- Icons from smiley to sad :( :)
- Feedback when they click
- Thank you message
- Apparent visually after they clicked which they clicked on
- Contact us at the bottom
- Add dark mode and light mode





In the next section, we shall be detailing the various user stories that our application would be based on.

## User stories

To store user stories, we used the Jira website. Below is an exerpt of some:

- As a user, I would like to know when I have submitted my form
- As a user, I would like to be able to navigate mouseless

To find the entire exerpt of user times, go to the read-me file and press the jira link.


## Sample plan of website

One of the most important aspects of creating a website is creating a sample plan. We decided to use figma as the tool 
to create a sample plan. To find the sample plan of the website, click the link of the Figma design in the README.md.
